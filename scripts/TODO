Method to prevent adding repo if exists (in install/fedora/add-repo)
Add support for KDE (Using $XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP)
    Use stow -d to set path and use two separate config folders for gnome && KDE XX
    use stow ignore for ignoring files irrelevant to corresponding distros
Add support of Antergos (use awk to separate the arguments)
    Separate Arch, Manjaro and Antergos installations if possible
Add Git config (name,username,editor,difftool(vimdiff))
backup & restore Dconf files (dconf dump and load)
Fix firefox-developer install script
call flatpak from main install script
----fix yay installation (cannot be installed through pacman)----
Using rsync to backup (delete source then after stow using rsync to restore missing files)
divide .zshrc into subfiles (alias,powerlevelconf,etc.)
Simplify pacman script (remove $OS arch as --needed wont reinstall)
separate gnome specific apps ($XDG variable)
cache sudo password using [read] or remove sudo from all the commands and use [sudo -u username] for regular stuff
